                            More Than Metrics is designed to find you the best employee for the job ‚≠ê We believe there's so much more to a person
                            than their grades, or their previous salary, or their appearance and our aim is to showcase the individual beyond those
                            outdated heuristics. In order to find you happy employees who love what they do, we think the recruitment process should
                            focus on who a person <em>really</em> is: their personality, their values, even their sense of humour. On More Than
                            Metrics, we want candidates to land interviews by being authentically themselves so leave your judgement at the door and
                            keep an open mind to get the best hires out of this process.
